# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web Application  

A **full-stack machine learning web application** that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data. Built using **React.js** for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be integrated into a modern web app with a clean, responsive interface.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  

## 🧭 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/BurlaSathwik/Diabetes-Prediction-App.git

cd Diabetes-Prediction-App
## ⚙️ 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

## Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend
Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload


The FastAPI server will start at:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000

💻 3. Frontend Setup (React)

Navigate to the frontend folder:

cd ../frontend

Install dependencies
npm install

Start the frontend development server
npm run dev


The React app will start at:
👉 http://localhost:5173

🔗 4. Connect Frontend and Backend

Ensure the backend (FastAPI) is running on port 8000.

The frontend makes API requests to http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict (or whichever route you defined).

You can configure this inside your React src/api or Axios setup file.
